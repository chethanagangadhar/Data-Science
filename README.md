# Data-Science

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This folder contains all the data science projects Iâ€™ve completed, each focusing on various aspects of data science, from data cleaning and preprocessing to advanced machine learning and deep learning applications.

Contents

Each project is organized in its own subdirectory, containing:

Project Documentation: Details of the project objective, methodology, and outcomes.
Data Files: Raw and processed datasets (where available).
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
Results: Visualizations, metrics, and insights generated from the analysis.
ReadMe: Each project includes a dedicated README file with additional information specific to that project.

Some key topics covered across the projects include:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering,
Exploratory data analysis (EDA),
Supervised and unsupervised machine learning models,
Deep learning and neural networks,
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 
Model evaluation and performance tuning


Each project showcases my journey in exploring data science concepts and applying them to real-world problems. Feel free to explore each folder for detailed information, code, and insights into my work.

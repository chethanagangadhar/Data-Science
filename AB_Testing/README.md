This project involves implementing and analyzing A/B testing to evaluate the impact of different variations on user behavior, engagement, and key performance metrics. A/B testing, a statistical method, helps in comparing two versions (A and B) to identify which one performs better for a given objective. This project uses Python for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights from the experiment.

Key Features

Data Processing: Cleans and prepares data for analysis, handling missing values and transforming data for accurate testing.
Statistical Testing: Implements hypothesis testing methods, including t-tests and chi-squared tests, to assess the statistical significance of results.
Visualization: Provides graphical representations of user behavior and performance metrics for each variation.
Interpretation of Results: Helps in drawing conclusions on which version (A or B) performs better based on statistical outcomes.

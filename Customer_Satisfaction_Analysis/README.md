Data Collection and Description:
The dataset includes customer information such as age, gender, purchase history, satisfaction ratings on product quality, delivery time, customer service, and website usability, along with metrics like return rate and discount usage.


Customer Segmentation:
Segment customers based on age, gender, and loyalty program membership to analyze satisfaction trends within each group. For instance, younger customers may rate product quality higher, while loyalty members often have higher satisfaction in delivery and service.

Visualization of Key Metrics:
Generate histograms for age, purchase amounts, ratings, and other key variables to reveal underlying trends and customer behaviors, such as the impact of age on return rates.

Net Promoter Score (NPS):
Classify customers into Promoters, Passives, and Detractors based on satisfaction ratings, calculate NPS, and identify areas for improvement. A negative NPS indicates low satisfaction and is a crucial insight for enhancement.

Root Cause Analysis:
Identify drivers of dissatisfaction by analyzing the characteristics of low-rated customers. For instance, high return rates may suggest dissatisfaction with product quality, while patterns in age groups can reveal targeted service improvement areas

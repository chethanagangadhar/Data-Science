This project demonstrates how to perform multivariate time series forecasting using Python. Multivariate time series forecasting predicts future values of multiple related variables by analyzing historical data. It is often used in financial markets, energy demand forecasting, and sensor monitoring systems where multiple interdependent time series exist.

Features

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Import historical data for multiple stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NFLX, GOOG).
Parse dates, handle missing values, and resample data as needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Identify trends, seasonal patterns, and interdependencies between variables.
Visualize closing prices and other stock metrics.

Stationarity Testing and Transformation:
Conduct Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity.
Apply differencing to make non-stationary series stationary.

Vector AutoRegression (VAR) Model Implementation:
Use the VAR model to capture interdependencies and predict future values.
Train and fit the model on the differenced dataset.

Forecasting and Visualization:
Forecast closing prices for a specified time period.
Visualize historical and forecasted prices for comparison.

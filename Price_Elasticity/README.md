The Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) Analysis project, Price_Elasticity, explores the sensitivity of consumer demand to price changes in a given product or service. By analyzing PED, this project aims to provide actionable insights into how pricing adjustments could impact revenue, enabling businesses to make data-driven pricing strategies and optimize profitability.

Key Objectives

Calculate Price Elasticity of Demand: Determine the degree to which demand for a product responds to changes in price.
Classify Elasticity Types: Identify whether demand is elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic for specific products.
Revenue Optimization: Provide insights into pricing strategies to maximize revenue based on elasticity analysis.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses sales and price data to prepare for analysis.
Elasticity Calculation: Implements formulas to compute elasticity values based on percentage changes in quantity demanded and price.
Classification: Classifies demand elasticity into various categories (elastic, inelastic, unit elastic) for strategic insights.
Visualization: Includes plots to visually represent the elasticity trends, aiding in deeper understanding.
